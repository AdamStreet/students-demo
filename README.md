# Students Demo

The exercise will consist of implementing a very simple iOS app. We've defined using [User Stories](user_guide.pdf) to help guide you along the process. There are simple mockups outlining the basic flow, but feel free to deviate. We're interested in seeing you implement the following technologies in the prototype, just remember this is an open ended exercise so feel free to be creative.

* Core Data
* Networking
* UIKit usage
* Test(able code)
